// Package dontpanic provides function wrappers and supervisors to ensure
// that wrapped code does not panic and cause program crashes.
//
// When should you use this package? Anytime you are running a function or
// goroutine where it isn't obvious whether it can or can't panic. This may
// be a higher risk in long running goroutines and functions or ones that are
// difficult to test completely.
