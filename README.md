--------------------------------------------

Gitaly is a Git [RPC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_procedure_call)
service for handling all the git calls made by GitLab.

To see where it fits in please look at [GitLab's architecture](https://docs.gitlab.com/ce/development/architecture.html#system-layout).

## Project Goals

Fault-tolerant horizontal scaling of Git storage in GitLab, and particularly, on [gitlab.com](https://gitlab.com).

This will be achieved by focusing on two areas (in this order):

  1. **Migrate from repository access via NFS to gitaly-proto, GitLab's new Git RPC protocol**
  1. **Evolve from large Gitaly servers managed as "pets" to smaller Gitaly servers that are "cattle"**

## Current Status

As of GitLab 11.5, almost all application code accesses Git repositories
through Gitaly instead of direct disk access. GitLab.com production no
longer uses direct disk access to touch Git repositories; the [NFS
mounts have been
removed](https://about.gitlab.com/2018/09/12/the-road-to-gitaly-1-0/).

For performance reasons some RPCs can be performed through NFS still. An
effort is made to mitigate performance issues by removing [Gitaly N+1](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/827).
Once that is no longer neccesairy we can conclude the migration project by
[removing the Git repository storage paths from gitlab-rails's
configuration](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitaly/issues/1282).

In the meantime we are building features according to our [roadmap][roadmap].

If you're interested in seeing how well Gitaly is performing on
GitLab.com, read about our [observibiltiy story](doc/observibility.md)!

## Installation

Most users won't install Gitaly on its own. It is already included in
[your GitLab installation](https://about.gitlab.com/install/).

Gitaly requires Go 1.13.9 or newer and Ruby 2.6. Run `make` to download
and compile Ruby dependencies, and to compile the Gitaly Go
executable.

Gitaly uses `git`. Versions `2.26.x` and `2.27.x` are supported.

## Configuration

The administration and reference guide is [documented in the GitLab project](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/gitaly/).

## Contributing

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Name

Gitaly is a tribute to git and the town of [Aly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aly). Where the town of
Aly has zero inhabitants most of the year we would like to reduce the number of
disk operations to zero for most actions. It doesn't hurt that it sounds like
Italy, the capital of which is [the destination of all roads](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_roads_lead_to_Rome). All git actions in
GitLab end up in Gitaly.

### Gitaly clients

As of Q4 2018, the following GitLab components act as Gitaly clients:

-   [gitlab-rails](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/blob/master/lib/gitlab/gitaly_client.rb):
    the main GitLab Rails application.
-   [gitlab-shell](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-shell/tree/master):
    for `git clone`, `git push` etc. via SSH.
-   [gitlab-workhorse](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-workhorse/blob/master/internal/gitaly/gitaly.go):
    for `git clone` via HTTPS and for slow requests that serve raw Git
    data.
    ([example](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitaly/raw/master/README.md))
-   [gitaly-ssh](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitaly/tree/master/cmd/gitaly-ssh):
    for internal Git data transfers between Gitaly servers.
-   [gitaly-ruby](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitaly/blob/master/ruby/lib/gitlab/git/gitaly_remote_repository.rb):
    for RPC's that interact with more than one repository, such as
    merging a branch.

The clients written in Go (gitlab-shell, gitlab-workhorse, gitaly-ssh)
use library code from the
[gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitaly/client](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitaly/tree/master/client)
package.

## High Availability

We are working on a high-availability (HA) solution for Gitaly based on
asynchronous replication. A Gitaly server would be made highly available
by assigning one or more standby servers ("secondaries") to it, each of
which contains a full copy of all the repository data on the primary
Gitaly server.

To implement this we are building a new GitLab component called
Praefect, which is hosted alongside the rest of Gitaly in this
repository. As we currently envision it, Praefect will have four
responsibilities:

-   route RPC traffic to the primary Gitaly server
-   inspect RPC traffic and mark repositories as dirty if the RPC is a
    "mutator"
-   ensure dirty repositories have their changes replicated to the
    secondary Gitaly servers
-   in the event of a failure on the primary, demote it to secondary and
    elect a new primary

Praefect has internal state: it needs to be able to "remember" which
repositories are in need of replication, and which Gitaly server is the
primary. [We will use Postgres to store Praefect's internal state](doc/proposals/praefect-queue-storage.md).

As of December 2019 we are busy rolling out the Postgres integration in
Praefect. The minimum supported Postgres version is 9.6, just like the
rest of GitLab.

## Further reading

More about the project and its processes is [detailed in the docs](doc/README.md).

## Distributed Tracing

Gitaly supports distributed tracing through [LabKit](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/labkit/) using [OpenTracing APIs](https://opentracing.io).

By default, no tracing implementation is linked into the binary, but different OpenTracing providers can be linked in using [build tags](https://golang.org/pkg/go/build/#hdr-Build_Constraints)/[build constraints](https://golang.org/pkg/go/build/#hdr-Build_Constraints). This can be done by setting the `BUILD_TAGS` make variable.

For more details of the supported providers, see LabKit, but as an example, for Jaeger tracing support, include the tags: `BUILD_TAGS="tracer_static tracer_static_jaeger"`.

```shell
$ make BUILD_TAGS="tracer_static tracer_static_jaeger"
```

Once Gitaly is compiled with an opentracing provider, the tracing configuration is configured via the `GITLAB_TRACING` environment variable.

For example, to configure Jaeger, you could use the following command:

```shell
GITLAB_TRACING=opentracing://jaeger ./gitaly config.toml
```

## Continuous Profiling

Gitaly supports Continuous Profiling through [LabKit][] using [Stackdriver Profiler](https://cloud.google.com/profiler).

For more information on how to set it up, see the [LabKit monitoring docs](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/labkit/-/blob/master/monitoring/doc.go).
